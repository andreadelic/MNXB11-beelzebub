O lord of flies, hear my plea

Though thou hath a devil set aside from he of Hydragyrum, be my friend be my friend
Though thou destroy the innocence of youth and rot as a pigs head, be my friend be my friend
Though thou was cast out of heaven yet let your children fly in it, be my friend be my friend

Saecula saeculorum, be my friend be my friend
Saecula saeculorum, be my friend be my friend
Saecula saeculorum, be my friend be my friend
Saecula saeculorum, be my friend be my friend
Saecula saeculorum, be my friend be my friend
Saecula saeculorum, be my friend be my friend

I summon thee Beelzebub, lord of flies
