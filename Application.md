Dear Mayor of Lund,

With a great pleasure I inform you that His Royal Highness Beelzebub, one of 7 princes of Hell, would like to apply for change of his legal name to Bibi Bees. I have no idea how the process looks like in Sweden, but I am sure you'll figure it out!

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Kacper Opas
